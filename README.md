# Project-Vriddhi

Really excited to share my first UI/UX based project. A very basic and simple design.

### How we started this project

We had a team of 9 members eager to work on human development, and came up with an idea to give people basic financial knowledge which they are lacking.
Proceeding with this project we wanted people to know more about what we want to do, our web-development team worked on this website and made this using very easy solutions we could find on google.
First we started with web-designing on figma(a really great platform for this field) and then proceeded for web-development.
